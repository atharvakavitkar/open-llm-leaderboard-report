Although it is difficult to completely dismiss the idea that some datasets or metrics may favor Hugging Face's Falcon, it still provides a good overall estimation of model performance.

With the addition of several key models and improvements in the performance of large-scale models, the changes in the number of parameters become noticeable.

The system is currently overheated, with the number of pending models exceeding 400. As a result, the performance of the models is starting to differ by decimal points. However, as initially suspected, the performance metrics may be biased towards Falcon, so it is advisable to use them as rough reference indicators rather than absolute quantitative measures. It has been observed that some models, despite having superior qualitative results, rank lower.
