# Open LLM Leaderboard Report Revision
#### 2023.06.10
- The system is currently overheated, with the number of pending models exceeding 400. As a result, the performance of the models is starting to differ by decimal points. However, as initially suspected, the performance metrics may be biased towards Falcon, so it is advisable to use them as rough reference indicators rather than absolute quantitative measures. It has been observed that some models, despite having superior qualitative results, rank lower.
- To alleviate the overheating of the leaderboard, the number of models to be visualized is adjusted to the top 70.
