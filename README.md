# Open-LLM-Leaderboard
https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard

The ðŸ¤— Open LLM Leaderboard tracks, ranks, and evaluates large language models and chatbots. It evaluates models based on benchmarks from the Eleuther AI Language Model Evaluation Harness, covering science questions, commonsense inference, multitask accuracy, and truthfulness in generating answers. The leaderboard allows community members to submit models for automated evaluation on the ðŸ¤— GPU cluster, as long as they are ðŸ¤— Transformers models with weights on the Hub. The benchmarks aim to test reasoning and general knowledge in different fields using 0-shot and few-shot settings.

Evaluation is performed against 4 popular benchmarks:

- AI2 Reasoning Challenge (25-shot) - a set of grade-school science questions.
- HellaSwag (10-shot) - a test of commonsense inference, which is easy for humans (~95%) but challenging for SOTA models.
- MMLU (5-shot) - a test to measure a text modelâ€™s multitask accuracy. The test covers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more.
- TruthfulQA (0-shot) - a benchmark to measure whether a language model is truthful in generating answers to questions.
It is chosed benchmarks as they test a variety of reasoning and general knowledge across a wide variety of fields in 0-shot and few-shot settings.
